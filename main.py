st.write(
    "In conclusion, we have discovered that there seems to be a correlation between age and the likeliness of subscribing to a plan. However, there is no correlation between age and the greater likelihood of a person subscribing to a higher rated plan. We can see through all the charts that as the age increases from 20-50 the chances of the person being subscribed to a plan increases however it seems to drop sharply once they go past the page of 50 this is likely due to the fact that they either have a distrust towards technology or donâ€™t know how to operate it properly however this is still a speculation. This is important because this means Netflix should cater more to the middle aged people due to the fact that they mostly make up their main paying demographics."
